  ## Installation
  To run Note Taker, it is already live on Heroku.

  To modify Note Taker, it requires the use of Node.js. After installing Node.js, you must install the node module: `Express` and `UUID`. 

  `Express` is for the server functionality, and `UUID` is used to generate a random ID for saved notes.

  ## Usage

  Using Note Taker is as simple as writing on some scratch paper or a post-it note! Clikc "Get Started" on the Main page to be taken to a screen where you can see a list of your saved notes on the left and a place to create a new note on the right. Notes must have a title AND a body in order for the Save icon to appear at the top. Click the "+" icon to start a fresh note.
